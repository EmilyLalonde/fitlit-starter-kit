## Testing

There is no boilerplate for testing in this starter-kit repo. You will need to set this up yourself. However, if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`).

## Linting Your Code

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit, but that's ok - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look only at the JavaScript files you have within the `src` and the `test` directories.
